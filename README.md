### Automated Builds

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build executables for Windows and Mac:
- Builds are triggered on pushes to main branch and pull requests
- Release builds are created automatically when a new release is published
- Built executables are available on the Releases page

The build process:
1. Sets up Python environment
2. Installs dependencies
3. Creates standalone executables using PyInstaller
4. Uploads executables as release assets

To create a new release:
1. Go to the Releases page
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag version and publish
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and attach the executables

```json
{
    "apps": {
        "App Name": {
            "url": "https://download.url/app.apk",
            "package_name": "com.example.app",
