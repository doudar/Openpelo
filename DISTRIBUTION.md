# OpenPelo Distribution Guide

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Why is the `openpelo.exe` file so small?
The `.exe` file generated by Flutter (in `build/windows/runner/Release`) is just a "wrapper" or entry point. It handles setting up the window and the engine.
- It does **not** contain your application code or assets directly.
- It loads them from the adjacent `data` folder and `flutter_windows.dll`.

### 2. Can I just send the `.exe` to users?
**No.** If you move the `.exe` out of its folder, it will crash immediately. You must distribute the **entire** `Release` folder.

### 3. Does the user need ADB installed?
**No.** 
- OpenPelo bundles the ADB binaries inside the application assets (in the `ADB/` folder).
- On the first valid run, the app extracts these binaries to the user's `AppData` folder.
- The app uses its own private copy of ADB and does not rely on any system PATH installation.

## How to Package for Users

To distribute the app professionally (as a single file), you should create an installer.

### Option A: Zip Distribution
1. Run `flutter build windows --release`
2. Go to `build\windows\runner\Release`
3. Zip the entire content of this folder.
4. Users unzip and run `openpelo.exe`.

### Option B: MSIX Installer (Recommended)
1. Add the msix package: `flutter pub add --dev msix`
2. Run: `flutter pub run msix:create`
3. This will generate a standalone `.msix` installer that users can double-click to install.

### Option C: Inno Setup
Use a tool like Inno Setup Compiler to create a standard `setup.exe` that wraps the Release folder content.
